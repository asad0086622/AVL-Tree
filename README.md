# AVL-Tree
The AVL Tree is an improvement upon the traditional Binary Search Tree (BST) that implements an auto-balancing feature, with the hopes to keep tree operations closer to O(logn) rather than O(n). After insertions and deletions that cause the tree to become unbalanced, special functions are called to manage the situation by rebalancing any nodes they find to be unbalanced.

# DRIVER CODE
In the driver code we use for loop for inserting and deletion of nodes till range 10.It will balance itself while every ilteration of insertion till 10 inputs.And similarly it will balance itself for outputs as well til range 10.
